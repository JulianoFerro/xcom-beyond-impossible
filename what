Beyond Impossible re-scales almost anything you can think of in Long War. The goal of the changes is to make everything scale well. So this means gear for soldiers are tiered better to where you would not consider skipping any weapon or armor tier. Ill list the values below and you will understand. Air game is slightly friendlier, and hidden potential is changed for the 1st 2 promotions to be great. Aliens are significantly buffed and perk trees reworked to crush certain gimmicky strategies that the AI could not compensate for; for example sniper rifles are no longer unlimited range, but rather only twice the additional shooting distance of marksman/lmg gun. The end result is a very difficult version of longwar where you really need to prioritize what you pursue in order to survive.

Soldier gear: All Gear has been scaled to where you will want and NEED every tier. Shortly after you could feasibly obtain certain gear, the aliens will compensate with additional stats or stronger, deadlier pods, via escalation mod.
