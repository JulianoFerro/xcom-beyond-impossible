Long War - Beyond Impossible with Escalation

How to install.

First, download Long War: http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/88/
Secondly, PatcherGUI: http://www.nexusmods.com/xcom/mods/448/?

Now for the files that you will need. I would recommend downloading all of them, and putting them into a folder somewhere and divide them up based on the 3 sections I am about to list.

It is recommended to download all of the files into a separate folder for easy access.

Config Files will go into a directory such as:  Path-To-Steam\steamapps\common\XCom-Enemy-Unknown\XEW\XComGame\Config. If you've found the folder containing the files, DefaultCamera, DefaultCheats, etc then you are in the right place.

This list of files you will download will go into the Config folder mentioned just above this. When asked to overwrite, you will overwrite. If needed, make a backup of the original files.

Important Notes:
Every time you started a new campaign, use "levelupbarracks" (without the quotes) in the console (used by pressing "\" )
Diminishing Returns Second Wave option is also recommended since the balancing is done with that in mind.
