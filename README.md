# What is this?

Long War Impossible is too easy. Snipers with a concealment Scout are just too strong, Lasers and pulse and other techs are completely skippable, it's too easy for XCom to get ahead and stay ahead. Escalation Mod is now used to create interesting and difficult plays throughout the game.

These changes attempt to:
- Add challenge to the later parts of the game
- Make all tiers of tech useful
- Make more choices difficult
   - Soldier promotion abilities
   - Tech path (Gauss vs. Aegis vs. MEC first, for example)
- Nerf abusive strategies (Infinite range snipers)
- Some playstyles or starts will affect the difficulty of these changes and are at the discretion of the player to use.

# Assumed Player Settings:

- Impossible Difficulty (this is Beyond Impossible, right?)
- Second Wave options:
  - #3  Hidden Potential
  - #8  Liberation
  - #12 Diminishing Returns
  - #17 Total Loss
  - #18 Commander's Choice
  - #29 Recon
- Console command to level up whole barracks after cheat ending first mission.
  - No one likes Rookies, they're just annoying and not fun.
- UFOs don't get to escape in March. Gift yourself a Firestorm if you have to.
- Extra steam vents to increase chance of adjacent steam. Only two steams should actually be used, however.
